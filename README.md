This is a chrome extension for detecting phishing websites by taking the URL from the browser tab and <br/>predicting it whether the url is a malicious one or safe to use.
The ML model used in this extension was XGBoost classifier, and the prediction model collects many URL features
like number of subdomains, whether it has a domain name or IP address, the length of the URL, whether the URL
contains '@', and so on.

Here is the sample output of our ML-based Chrome extension for detecting phishing URLs.
